# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
A middleware function is quite similar to a normal controller function. It can use res and req. The difference is that it can take a third argument. That third argument is 'next'. Which when called will continue the sort of chain of functions, i.e it will pass it on to the other controllers.
