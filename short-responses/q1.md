# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
A middleware function is quite similar to a normal controller function. It can use res and req. The difference is that it can take a third argument. That third argument is 'next'. Which when called will continue the sort of chain of functions, i.e it will pass it on to the other controllers.

This after reading a few times I figured out what you meant to say. This answer is unclear and if a manager saw this they would push for a better response. One that is more clear.
